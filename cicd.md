 **What is Continuous Integration?** 
 - Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository where automated builds and tests run. The main goal of CI is to detect and locate issues early in the development cycle.
 
 **What is Continuous Deployment?** 
 - Continuous Deployment (CD) is an extension of Continuous Delivery (CD) since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.

- Bamboo
 **How do you set up a CI/CD pipeline?** To set up a CI/CD pipeline, you need to:
- Choose your CI/CD tool
- Define your pipeline stages
- Configure your pipeline stages
- Create your pipeline script
 **What are some best practices for CI/CD?** Some best practices for CI/CD include:
- Automate everything
- Keep your pipeline simple
- Use version control for your pipeline scripts
- Use containers for your builds and deployments
- Use infrastructure as code
 **How do you handle version control in a CI/CD pipeline?** To handle version control in a CI/CD pipeline, you should use version control for your pipeline scripts.
 **How do you handle testing in a CI/CD pipeline?** To handle testing in a CI/CD pipeline, you should:
- Write automated tests for your application
- Run unit tests as part of your build stage
- Run integration tests as part of your deployment stage
 **How do you handle deployment in a CI/CD pipeline?** To handle deployment in a CI/CD pipeline, you should:
- Use containers for your deployments
- Deploy to staging environments first before deploying to production environments.
 **How do you handle rollbacks in a CI/CD pipeline?** Rollbacks in a CI/CD pipeline can be handled by:
- Reverting the code changes
- Using feature flags
- Using canary releases
 **How do you handle security in a CI/CD pipeline?** To handle security in a CI/CD pipeline, you should:
- Lock down configuration managers, systems that host repositories and the build servers
- Monitor the pipeline from end to end with watertight access control across the entire toolchain
- Use secrets management tools
 **How do you handle scalability in a CI/CD pipeline?** To handle scalability in a CI/CD pipeline, you should:
- Use cloud-based infrastructure
- Use containers for your builds and deployments
- Use infrastructure as code
 **How do you handle monitoring in a CI/CD pipeline?** To handle monitoring in a CI/CD pipeline, you should:
- Monitor your pipeline from end to end
- Use dashboards to visualize your pipeline metrics
- Use alerts to notify you of issues
 **How do you handle logging in a CI/CD pipeline?** To handle logging in a CI/CD pipeline, you should:
- Log everything that happens in your pipeline
- Use centralized logging tools
